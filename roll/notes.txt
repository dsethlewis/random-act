I'm thinking about how to store persistent data beyond the pickle. Eventually, I want to get to a SQL database, but RealPython suggested a CSV file as a stepping stone, and I think that makes a lot of sense.

What I'm trying to figure out is what exactly I want to store in the CSV. Let's say I start with a simple history of activities I've done.

Then, the CSV could have columns for:
- id (key value)
- timestamp (when I click do)
- title
- ancestry
- pomo (whether this occurred while a pomodoro was active)

As a separate note, I probably want to use a delimiter other than commas because some of my titles have commas. Let's see how Python handles quoting first.

If I want to use activity_id, I need to create that in the program. But the more I think about it, the less I think I want to do an activity_id. Instead, title and ancestry can uniquely identify an activity.
